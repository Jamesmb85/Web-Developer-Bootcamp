<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- the doctype. In the mists of time, when HTML was young (about 1991/2), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things. However, these days no one really cares about them, and they are really just a historical artefact that needs to be included for everything to work right. For now, that's all you need to know. -->

<!-- This element wraps all the content on the entire page, and is sometimes known as the root element. -->
<head>
	<!-- This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more -->

	<!-- The HTML Content Division element (<div>) is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled using CSS. As a "pure" container, the <div> element does not inherently represent anything. Instead, it's used to group content so it can be easily styled using the class or id attributes, marking a section of a document as being written in a different language (using the lang attribute), and so on. -->

	<!-- The HTML <hr> element represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements (for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic with a section); historically, this has been presented as a horizontal rule or line. While it may still be displayed as a horizontal rule in visual browsers, this element is now defined in semantic terms, rather than presentational terms, so if you wish to draw a horizontal line, you should do so using appropriate CSS. -->
